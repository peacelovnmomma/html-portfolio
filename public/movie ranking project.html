<h1>Jenny's Most Recently Watched Strange Movies</h1>
<h2>I've been on a kick of watching strange movies to help me dissociate</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Deliverance</h3>
<p>This was an exorcism type adventure. A family is terrorized by the demonic entity in their home.</p>
<h3>In the Tall Grass</h3>
<p>Stephen King, time loop, death, terror, and a strange rock that sucks you in!</p>
<h3>No One Gets Out Alive</h3>
<p>Did not go the way I thought it would. Spooky old house turned cheap apartment rentals for wayward women. Box with a demon that eats sacraficial offerings, seemingly with a mouth much akin to a vagina.</p>
